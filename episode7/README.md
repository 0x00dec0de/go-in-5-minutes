# Vendoring Dependencies in Go

Go in 5 Minutes, episode 7.

This screencast shows how to vendor your dependencies in Go, the modern way.

Note: Go dependency vendoring has been fast evolving in the past. Tools and implementation standards still are, but the standard Go toolchain is forming a [standard for vendoring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz5-UB7g2uPBdOx-rw5t9MxJwkfpx90cqG9AFL0JAYo/edit). Implementations may change in the future, but the basic vendoring idea and semantics will likely stay the same.
