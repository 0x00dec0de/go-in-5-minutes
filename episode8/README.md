## 2 Months!

This is the official 2 month anniversary of Go In 5 Minutes! The show has grown faster than I anticipated and it's all thanks to all of you. Your Github stars, Youtube subscriptions and idea submissions ([shameless plug](https://github.com/arschles/go-in-5-minutes/issues)) really motivate me to produce the best screencasts I possibly can.

Thank you all, and I'm looking forward to everything to come!
